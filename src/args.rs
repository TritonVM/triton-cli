// Unfortunately, clap does not support deriving `clap::Args` for enums yet.
// The workaround is to define a struct, declare it as a required group, and
// prohibit the group being mentioned more than once. In effect, this means the
// group has to be named exactly once ‚Äì it's a worse enum!
//
// A significant downside is that clap cannot communicate which of the
// ‚Äúvariants‚Äù was selected. To the best of my knowledge, this has to be done
// by checking for the absence of a field, like `initial_state.is_none()`. ü§¶
